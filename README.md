2. Specify the number of available points to distribute.
3. You will then be prompted to enter the name of each song, after every song you ar asked if the next song is of the same rank or not.
4. If the next song is the same rank, select (y). Otherwise, select (n) to iterate to the next rank.
5. Once all songs are added, you will specify the number of songs that you want to give 0 points.

## Known Issues

This program is very simple, and does not have adequate error handling. It also does not have a GUI (although a GUI is not that important for this application).
